                <p>I'm Elizabeth Flegg and I began my creative career in digital photography at Algonquin College, but
                    after
                    graduating it just wasn't the right fit. I went on to point my creativity towards food where I
                    worked as
                    a cook in restaurants for many years. I loved creating stunning and delicious things to share with
                    those
                    around me, taking inspiration from the colours and products themselves</p>
                <p>Feeling creatively reinvigorated, I decided it was time to take these ideas in a different direction,
                    so
                    I went back to school. I studied graphic applications in desktop publishing which piqued my interest
                    in
                    UI design and web development. I continued with a focused program in Web Design and User Interface
                    at
                    Concordia University. I took a deeper dive into design and UX specifically in relation to web design
                    and
                    development.</p>
                <p>I love that design offers me a unique opportunity to create beauty as well as functionality. I'm
                    amazed
                    that by combining the logic and structure of code with artistic expression we can create truly
                    wonderful
                    online spaces. I'm inspired everyday by the beautiful city I live in, filled with life, art, culture
                    and
                    especially creative people of all kinds.</p>

            <article class="about-erin">
                <p>I'm Erin Flegg, lead developer and west coast contingent of Flegg Creative. I believe technology
                    should
                    be accessible. It should work in service of creative and innovative people, not the other way
                    around.
                </p>
                <p>After completing a degree in English lit and history, I wanted to push my writing skills and explore
                    my
                    creativity. I got an MFA in creative writing from the University of British Columbia (I had to write
                    a
                    novel to get it!) and spent the next years working as a freelance writer, publishing everything from
                    local news stories to national features with a smattering of fiction and poetry thrown in.</p>
                <p>A decade later, burnout drove me straight into the arms of my local technical institute (BCIT) where
                    I
                    received a diploma in new media design and web development. From there I've been lucky to combine my
                    creative tendencies with my tech skills, working as a user experience designer for the Vancouver Art
                    Gallery, art director for award-winning Asparagus Magazine [link to case study] and finally for
                    myself
                    as a full-stack developer bringing to life the digital dreams of a variety of smart people and
                    organizations.</p>
                <p>Years of working with clients in a variety of fields have shown me that clarity and simplicity are
                    the
                    keys to letting your creative vision shine through. And our continued education in accessibility
                    (via
                    courses through The A11y Collective, Deque Systems amazing annual accessibility conference and
                    others)
                    has led us to create our own systems to ensure technology supports your vision and gets out of the
                    way
                </p>
                <p>I draw strength and inspiration from beautiful Quw'utsun territory where I live, and when I'm not
                    writing
                    words or lines of code, I'm loading another roll of film into one of my (too) many cameras to
                    capture
                    life on rural Vancouver Island.</p>
